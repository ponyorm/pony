# Pony ORM Release 0.7.2 (2017-07-17)

## New features

* All arguments of db.bind() can be specified as keyword arguments. Previously Pony required the first positional argument which specified the database provider. Now you can pass all the database parameters using the dict: db.bind(**db_params). See https://docs.ponyorm.com/api_reference.html#Database.bind
* The `optimistic` attribute option is added https://docs.ponyorm.com/api_reference.html#cmdoption-arg-optimistic

## Bugfixes

* Fixes #219: when a database driver raises an error, sometimes this error was masked by the 'RollbackException: InterfaceError: connection already closed' exception. This happened because on error, Pony tried to rollback transaction, but the connection to the database was already closed and it masked the initial error. Now Pony displays the original error which helps to understand the cause of the problem.
* Fixes #276: Memory leak
* Fixes the __all__ declaration. Previously IDEs, such as PyCharm, could not understand what is going to be imported by 'from pony.orm import *'. Now it works fine.

* Bug fixed: when required attribute is empty the loading from the database shouldn't raise the validation error. Now Pony raises the warning DatabaseContainsIncorrectEmptyValue
* Throw an error with more clear explanation when a list comprehension is used inside a query instead of a generator expression: "Use generator expression (... for ... in ...) instead of list comprehension [... for ... in ...] inside query"


# Pony ORM Release 0.7 (2016-10-11)

Starting with this release Pony ORM is release under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## New features

* Added getattr() support in queries: https://docs.ponyorm.com/api_reference.html#getattr

## Backward incompatible changes

* #159: exceptions happened during flush() should not be wrapped with CommitException

Before this release an exception that happened in a hook(https://docs.ponyorm.com/api_reference.html#entity-hooks), could be raised in two ways - either wrapped into the CommitException or without wrapping. It depended if the exception happened during the execution of flush() or commit() function on the db_session exit. Now the exception happened inside the hook never will be wrapped into the CommitException.

## Bugfixes

# Pony ORM Release 0.6 (2014-11-05)

* Fixed #94: Aggregated subquery bug fixed

# Pony ORM Release Candidate 0.6rc3 (2014-10-30)

## Bugfixes

* Fixed #18: Allow to specify `size` and `unsigned` for int type
* Fixed #77: Discriminate Pony-generated fields in entities: Attribute.is_implicit field added
* Fixed #83: Entity.get() should issue LIMIT 2 when non-unique criteria used for search
* Fixed #84: executing db.insert() should turn off autocommit and begin transaction

## New features

* `size` and `unsigned` options for `int` attributes [`link`](http://doc.ponyorm.com/entities.html#max-integer-number-size)

Since the `long` type has gone in Python 3, the `long` type is deprecated in Pony now. Instead of `long` you should use the `int` type and specify the `size` option:

```python
    class MyEntity(db.Entity):
        attr1 = Required(long) # deprecated
        attr2 = Required(int, size=64) # new way for using BIGINT type in the database
```

# Pony ORM Release Candidate 0.6rc2 (2014-10-10)

## Bugfixes

* Fixes #81: python3.3: syntax error during installation in ubuntu 14.04


# Pony ORM Release Candidate 0.6rc1 (2014-10-08)

## New features:

* Python 3 support
* pymysql adapter support for MySQL databases

## Backward incompatible changes

Now Pony treats both `str` and `unicode` attribute types as they are unicode strings in both Python 2 and 3. So, the attribute declaration `attr = Required(str)` is equal to `attr = Required(unicode)` in Python 2 and 3. The same thing is with `LongStr` and `LongUnicode` - both of them are represented as unicode strings now.

For the sake of backward compatibility Pony adds `unicode` as an alias to `str` and `buffer` as an alias to `bytes` in Python 3.

## Other changes and bug fixes

* Fixes #74: Wrong FK column type when using sql_type on foreign ID column
* Fixes #75: MappingError for self-referenced entities in a many-to-many relationship
* Fixes #80: “Entity NoneType does not belong to database” when using to_dict


# Pony ORM Release 0.5.4 (2014-09-22)

## New functions and methods:

* `pony.orm.serialization` module with the `to_dict()` and `to_json()` functions was added. Before this release you could use the `to_dict()` method of an entity instance in order to get a key-value dictionary structure for a specific entity instance. Sometimes you might need to serialize not only the instance itself, but also the instance's related objects. In this case you can use the `to_dict()` function from the pony.orm.serialization module.

  * [`to_dict()`](http://doc.ponyorm.com/working_with_entity_instances.html#to_dict) - receives an entity instance or a list of instances and returns a dictionary structure which keeps the passed object(s) and immediate related objects

  * [`to_json()`](http://doc.ponyorm.com/working_with_entity_instances.html#to_json) – uses `to_dict()` and returns JSON representation of the `to_dict()` result

* [`Query.prefetch()`](http://doc.ponyorm.com/queries.html#Query.prefetch) – allows to specify which related objects or attributes should be loaded from the database along with the query result . Example:

```python
      select(s for s in Student).prefetch(Group, Department, Student.courses)
```

* [`obj.flush()`](http://doc.ponyorm.com/working_with_entity_instances.html#Entity.flush) – allows flush a specific entity to the database

* [`obj.get_pk()`](http://doc.ponyorm.com/working_with_entity_instances.html#Entity.get_pk) – return the primary key value for an entity instance

* [`py_check`](http://doc.ponyorm.com/entities.html#py_check) parameter for attributes added. This parameter allows you to specify a function which will be used for checking the value before it is assigned to the attribute. The function should return `True`/`False` or can raise `ValueError` exception if the check failed. Example:

```python
    class Student(db.Entity):
        name = Required(unicode)
        gpa = Required(float, py_check=lambda val: val >= 0 and val <= 5)
```

## New types:

* `time` and `timedelta` – now you can use these types for attribute declaration. Also you can use `timedelta` and a combination of `datetime` + `timedelta` types inside queries.

## New hooks:

* `after_insert`, `after_update`, `after_delete` - these hooks are called when an object was inserted, updated or deleted in the database respectively ([link](http://doc.ponyorm.com/working_with_entity_instances.html#entity-hooks))

## New features:

* Added support for pymysql – pure Python MySQL client. Currently it is used as a fallback for MySQLdb interface

## Other changes and bug fixes

* `obj.order_by()` method is deprecated, use `Entity.select().order_by()` instead
* `obj.describe()` now displays composite primary keys
* Fixes #50: PonyORM does not escape _ and % in LIKE queries
* Fixes #51: Handling of one-to-one relations in declarative queries
* Fixes #52: An attribute without a column should not have rbits & wbits
* Fixes #53: Column generated at the wrong side of "one-to-one" relationship
* Fixes #55: `obj.to_dict()` should do flush at first if the session cache is modified
* Fixes #57: Error in `to_dict()` when to-one attribute value is None
* Fixes #70: EntitySet allows to add and remove None
* Check that the entity name starts with a capital letter and throw exception if it is not then raise the `ERDiagramError: Entity class name should start with a capital letter` exception


# Pony ORM Release 0.5.3 (2014-08-12)

This release fixes the setup.py problem that was found after the previous release was uploaded to PyPI.


# Pony ORM Release 0.5.2 (2014-08-11)

This release is a step forward to Python 3 support. While the external API wasn't changed, the internals were significantly refactored to provide forward compatibility with Python 3. 

## Changes/features:

* New to_dict() method can be used to convert entity instance to dictionary. This method can be useful when you need to serialize an object to JSON or other format ([link](http://blog.ponyorm.com/2014/08/11/pony-orm-release-0-5-2/))

## Bugfixes:

* Now select() function and filter() method of the query object can accept lambdas with closures
* Some minor bugs were fixed


# Pony ORM Release 0.5.1 (2014-07-11)

## Changes/features:

Before this release, if a text attribute was defined without the max length specified (e.g. `name = Required(unicode)`), Pony set the maximum length equal to 200 and used SQL type `VARCHAR(200)`. Actually, PostgreSQL and SQLite do not require specifying the maximum length for strings. Starting with this release such text attributes are declared as `TEXT` in SQLite and PostgreSQL. In these DBMSes, the `TEXT` datatype has the same performance as `VARCHAR(N)` and doesn't have arbitrary length restrictions.

For other DBMSes default varchar limit was increased up to 255 in MySQL and to 1000 in Oracle.

## Bugfixes:

* Correct parsing of datetime values with T separator between date and time
* Entity.delete() bug fixed
* Lazy attribute loading bug fixed


# Pony ORM Release 0.5 (2014-05-31)
