Pony Object-Relational Mapper
-----------------------------
Pony is an object-relational mapper. The most interesting feature of Pony is its ability to write queries to the database using generator expressions. Pony works with entities which are mapped to a SQL database. Using generator syntax for writing queries allows the user to formulate very eloquent queries. It increases the level of abstraction and allows a programmer to concentrate on the business logic of the application. For this purpose Pony analyzes the abstract syntax tree of a generator and translates it to its SQL equivalent.

Following is an example of a query in Pony:

    select(p for p in Product if p.name.startswith('A') and p.cost <= 1000)

Pony translates queries to SQL using a specific database dialect. Currently Pony works with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.

The package pony.orm.examples contains several examples.
